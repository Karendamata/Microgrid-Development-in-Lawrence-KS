	<h2>Summertime Power in a Small (300 sqft)Shop or Restaurant</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="cell">
			The smallest electrical system in Lawrence's downtown is the electrical system in one small shop or restaurant, which typically occupies one lot and is two stories tall.
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			One lot is 25 feet wide and 120 feet deep. Most of the downtown properties are this size. However, some are taller and/or occupy two or more lots. For one of these larger properties, scale yp the values in the table below.

	<h3>Typical System Description</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="cell">
			To avoid rooftop HVAC clutter, maximize efficiency, and facilitate thermaal storage, a ground-source heat pump heats and cools water for HVAC and provides free heat for domestic hot water during the cooling season. Peak electrical consumption (at 4:00 PM) is about 7.5 kW. At peak cooling load, the HVAC equipment consumes 4 kW. 
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			At noon, the HVAC cooling equipment uses 2 kW to cool spaces and 2 kW to chill water for storage and use at later time. Chilled-water storage between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM stores enough cooling to provide maximum cooling for 3 evening hours. With 15% capacity factor (50% clouds), solar collectors rated at 18 kW save $3300/year.
